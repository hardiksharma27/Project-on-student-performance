# Nexyug Classes Project

 This project explores student performance data to identify trends and insights using Python and data science tools. It's ideal for beginners looking to understand           how to clean, transform, and analyze data in a structured way.


# Project Overview

The goal of this notebook is to analyze a dataset called StudentsPerformance.csv which contains information about students' demographics, their participation in test preparationcourses, and their scores in math, reading, and writing. Using this data, we aim to:
      
   1.Clean and prepare the dataset.

   2.Perform basic statistical analysis.

   3.Apply label encoding to categorical variables.

   4.Visualize and interpret performance trends.

 # What You'll Learn

   1.Loading and previewing CSV data with pandas

   2.Checking and handling missing data

   3.Encoding categorical variables using LabelEncoder

   4.Visualizing data distributions and correlations

   5.Understanding how different factors (like parental education, gender, lunch types, etc.) influence student performance



# Dependencies

To run this notebook smoothly, make sure you have the following libraries installed:

     pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

 # Dataset Description

   The dataset contains the following columns:

   |     Column                 |   Descripiton                      |
   | -------------------------- | -----------------------------------|
   | gender                     | Male or Female                     |
   | race\ethencity             | Group A,B,C,D or E                 |
   | paretal level of education | parents highest level of education |
   | lunch                      | Standard or free \ Reduced Lunch   |
   |test preparation course     | Completed or None                  |
   | math score                 | Math exam score (0-100)            |
   | reading score              | Reading exam score (0-100)         |
   | writing score              | Writing exam score (0-100)         |

   
# Key Steps

1. Load and View Data

       Har = pd.read_csv("StudentsPerformance (1).csv")
       Har.head()

2. Data Cleaning

   Check for missing values:

       Har.isnull().sum()

3. Encode Categorical Columns

    Label encoding is used to convert text categories into numeric labels for ML models.

4. Data Analysis

    Plotted the score distributions using Histograms 
    Compared the average values by gender , lunch type and test preparation
    Created the correlation heatmap
    Have used the boxplots and barplots for the insights

5.Features Enginerring 

   Created a new column average_score
   Created a new column result which consist of :
   
     1. "Pass" if average score ≥ 50
     2. else "Fail"
     
   Converted the result to binary labels(0 and 1) , by using LabelEncoder 

-----

# Used Machine Learning Models

 1. Prediction 

       Used the following models to predict "Pass" or "Fail":
       1. Logistic Regression
       2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

       Also checked the following things : 
         1.Accuracy Score
         2.Classification Report
         3.Confusion Matrix


2. Clustering 

   Used  K-Means Clustering to group students based on performance patterns
   Cluster by math score, reading score, and writing score
   Visualize clusters using 2D plots

# Sample Output Preview

gender	race	education	lunch	prep course	math	reading	writing

Female	B	Bachelor	Standard	None	72	72	74
Male	C	Some College	Reduced	Completed	47	57	44


After label encoding:

Gender becomes 0 (female) or 1 (male)

Lunch becomes 0 or 1

Other categories are also numerically mapped

# Conclusion

By the end of this project, you'll be able to:

Handle and clean real-world datasets

Apply preprocessing steps like encoding

Analyze trends in educational data

Build visual representations to support findings
